# Magic Potion #
Magic Potion is a meta domain specific language (DSL) that introduces the ontology paradigm for business domain modeling into Clojure.
It helps you describe your data model in terms of concepts (like car, person, company, employee), properties (like name, creation date, amount, membership) and constraints on top of Clojure's structs and persistent maps. Magic Potion attaches metadata to Plain Old Clojure Maps (POCMs), which describes your model and enables effortless validation of map values. You still use POCMs, so you get all the benefits of Clojure's persistent maps.
